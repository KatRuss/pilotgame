# Pilot Game
## Overview
This is the Unity project files for the Arm Pilot Game Mobile demo, for showcasing and developing Performance Studio. 

This is used in conjuntion while developing Performance Studio. Providing a centeralised way to way to test potential issues with dev builds of the software.

 Previously there were no standardised software that were used for this purpose, and developers were just using whatever mobile games they had on hand, with no guarentees if the issues they were facing were because of the game itself or Performance Studio.

This should help by providing a means to have an internal game that can be fixed interally if issues are found.

This code is provided as a means to fix bugs and add funtionality.

## 1. Developed On
This was created using Unity 6.2.7f2: 
- Unity Version Achive can be downloaded [here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) if needed.
- It does not use any 3rd party Unity Store Assets, so it *should* continue working on newer versions of Unity 6 and beyond. 
- It likely will not run properly on Unity 2023 or earlier, but this hasn't been tested yet.

## 2. Installation (For Mobile)
1. Download the [latest release here]()
2. Sideload the .APK on an Android device, the exact method depends on the device being tested, but generally involves moving the .APK onto the system's storage and installing it on device.

## 3. Installation (for Development)
1. Clone the Repo
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/KatRuss/pilotgame.git
```
2. Add Project to Unity Hub

## 4. Usage
### As a Mobile Game
It is designed to be run in conjunction with Arm Performance Studio.
